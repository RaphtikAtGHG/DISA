# DISA
Digital Instruction Set Architecture

## What does DISA mean?
DISA means Digital Instruction Set Architecture. That means for me that this architecture is only digital. So basically it's an architecture that is just software.

## Why did you make DISA?
I made DISA as a hobby of designing a CPU architecture. My end goal is to build a DISA CPU in real life.

## What is a Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)?
In computer science, an instruction set architecture (ISA) is a part of the abstract model of a computer, which generally defines how software controls the CPU. A device that executes instructions described by that ISA, such as a central processing unit (CPU), is called an implementation.

In general, an ISA defines the supported instructions, data types, registers, the hardware support for managing main memory, fundamental features (such as the memory consistency, addressing modes, virtual memory), and the input/output model of a family of implementations of the ISA.
